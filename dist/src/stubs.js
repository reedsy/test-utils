// Stubbing occurs when in vnode transformer we're swapping
// component vnode type due to stubbing either component
// or directive on component
// In order to be able to find components we need to track pairs
// stub --> original component
// Having this as global might feel unsafe at first point
// One can assume that sharing stub map across mounts might
// lead to false matches, however our vnode mappers always
// produce new nodeTypes for each mount even if you're reusing
// same stub, so we're safe and do not need to pass these stubs
// for each mount operation
